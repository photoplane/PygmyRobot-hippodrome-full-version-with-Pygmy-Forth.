# PygmyRobot-hippodrome-full-version-with-Pygmy-Forth.

A single operation groups together all the codes made with a line follower on a circuit. At the beginning it is a simple racetrack, then with the left and right surface sensors we make a round trip. The central surface sensor then detects an object and triggers an obstacle avoidance procedure. To finish the ground sensors on the left and right detect a black stripe on the surface and initiate half-turns, clockwise and counter-clockwise and again a simple racetrack closes the sequence.
In this realization all the ground and surface sensors were used.
